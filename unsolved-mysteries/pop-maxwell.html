For years, physicists have sought for and found unified theories.
<P>

<dl>
<dt>1861-1865</dt>
<dd>James Maxwell, in a series of pages,
 described the interrelation of electric
and magnetic fields thereby unifying them into electromagnetism.  
This led to the now-famous Maxwell's Equations. </dd>
<P>

<dt>1881-1884
<dd>Hertz demonstrated radio 
waves and established that radio waves and light are
electromagnetic waves of different frequencies,
 as predicted by Maxwell's theory.

</dl>
<p>
<HR>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>1967-1970
<dd>Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg proposed a theory that unifies
electromagnetic and weak interactions. 
<P>
They predicted the mass of the 
W boson which mediates weak processes such as beta
decay and predicted a new type of 
weak interaction and its mediating particle the Z
boson.  Evidence for this new type of process was soon found.  
They also predicted the Higgs Boson.
<P>

<dt>1979
<dd> The Nobel Prize was awarded to Glashow, Salam, and 
Weinberg for their role
in the development of the electroweak theory, 
four years before the discovery of 
the W and Z bosons!
<P>

<dt>1983
<dd>The W and Z bosons were finally discovered in 1983 by the UA-1 and 
UA-2 experiments at CERN.
These discoveries dramatically confirmed the Standard Model.  
Detectors at today's accelerators have observed over 100,000 W's and millions of Z's.
