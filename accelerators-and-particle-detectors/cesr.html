The Cornell Electron-Positron Storage Ring (CESR) is an
electron-positron collider with a circumference of 768 meters,
 located 12 meters below the ground at  Cornell University campus. 
It is capable of producing collisions
 between electrons and their anti-particles,
positrons, with
center-of-mass energies between 9 and 12 GeV.  The products of these 
collisions are studied with a detection apparatus,
called the CLEO detector.

<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=>Linear Accelerator (LINAC)
<OPTION>Electrons emitted from a heated filament are accelerated
<OPTION>in a special 30 meter long vacuum pipe.  Positrons,
 the 
<OPTION>positively charged antiparticles of the electron
<OPTION>are produced by accelerating electrons up to 140 MeV at 
<OPTION>an intermediate point of the linac where they strike a 
<OPTION>tungsten plate.  A spray of electrons,
 positrons and 
<OPTION>x rays emerges from the plate.
</SELECT>
<br />
<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=>Synchrotron

<OPTION>The synchrotron accepts the 150 MeV electrons or positrons
<OPTION>from the linac and accelerates them to the energy at
<OPTION>which they are stored in CESR,
 typically 5 GeV (5000 MeV).  
<OPTION>For most of the circumference of the ring the particles travel
<OPTION>in vacuum between the poles of bending magnets,
 arranged 
<OPTION>in 192 3-meter long sections.  At four places in the ring the
<OPTION>beam passes through a 3-meter long linear accelerator.  
<OPTION>After a bunch of electrons or positrons has made 4,
000
<OPTION>circuits around the ring (in about a hundredth of a second),
 it 
<OPTION>reaches its maximum energy and is injected into the 
<OPTION>storage ring. 
</SELECT>
<br />
<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=>Storage Ring
<OPTION>Electrons and positrons travel around the storage ring
<OPTION>in bunches at 390 thousand revolutions per second (kHz),


<OPTION>with 7 approximately evenly spaced bunches of electrons
<OPTION>colliding inside the CLEO detector with 7 bunches of
<OPTION>of positrons traveling in the opposite direction.
</SELECT>
<br />
<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=> CLEO II detector
<OPTION>CLEO II is a multipurpose high energy physics detector
<OPTION>used to analyze electron-positron collision events 
<OPTION>generated by the CESR 10 GeV storage ring.  The
<OPTION>CLEO II detector is operated by a collaboration of over 
<OPTION>100 physicists from many institutions
