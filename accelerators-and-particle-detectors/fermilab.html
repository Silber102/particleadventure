<p>
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, a high-energy physics laboratory,
named after particle physicist pioneer Enrico Fermi,
is located 30 miles west of Chicago.  
It is the home of the world's most powerful particle accelerator,
the Tevatron, which was used to discover the
top quark.

<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=>Booster:
<OPTION>There is a short linear accelerator and a 95 meter
<OPTION>booster accelerator.  Hydrogen is ionized (stripped
<OPTION> of its electrons), leaving protons, which are
<OPTION>accelerated to 8 GeV before injection into the main
<OPTION>accelerator.
</SELECT>
<br />
<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=>Antiproton Production
<OPTION>Protons are crashed into a target.  Antiprotons found
<OPTION>among the resulting particles are collected in the
<OPTION>antiproton accumulator, and then sent in the opposite

<OPTION>direction as the protons in the ring.
</SELECT>
<br />
<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=>Tevatron
<OPTION>The main accelerator,
 the Tevatron is a synchrotron
<OPTION>about 6.4 kilometers around. Conventional and
<OPTION>superconducting magnets bend the proton beam
<OPTION>and the antiproton beam in the opposite directions.
<OPTION>At regular intervals the beams pass through regions
<OPTION> of an electric field which accelerates them.  The
<OPTION>beams of protons and antiprotons are both at 1 trillion
<OPTION>electron-volts (TeV),
 so they produce 2 TeV collisions
<OPTION>at their center of mass.
</SELECT>
<br />

<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=>Collider (CDF) and D0 Detectors
<OPTION>The proton and antiproton beams can be steered
<OPTION>(by magnets) to cross in these detectors.  In the
<OPTION>resulting collisions, the detectors record information 
<OPTION>about the emerging particles. CDF and D0 discovered the 
<OPTION>top quark. 
</SELECT>
<br />
<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=>Fixed-Target Areas
<OPTION>Proton, neutrino, and meson beams are steered by
<OPTION>magnets to cross in these detectors.  In the resulting
<OPTION>collisions, the detectors record information about
<OPTION>the emerging particles.  
</SELECT>
<br />

<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=>Main Injector
<OPTION>The Main Injector is roughly half the size of the
<OPTION>main ring.  The Main Injector improved the  performance
<OPTION>of the Tevatron by increasing the number
<OPTION>of protons and antiprotons that collide at high energy.
