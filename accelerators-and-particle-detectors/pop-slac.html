Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
located just south of San Francisco,
 is the longest linear accelerator in the world.
It accelerates electrons and positrons down its 
2-mile length to various targets, rings
and detectors at its end.  The PEP ring shown is being rebuilt for the 
<a href="b_factory.html">B factory</a>,
 which will study some of the
mysteries of antimatter using B mesons.
Related physics will be done at Cornell with <a href="cesr.html">
CESR</a> and in Japan with <a href="kek.html">KEK</a>.

<FORM>
<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=> ELECTRON GUN:
<OPTION>An electron gun works in a similar way 
<OPTION>to your television: a hot cathode releases
<OPTION>electrons which are accelerated by an
<OPTION>electric field.  By the time they enter the 
<OPTION>main accelerator,
 they are already moving
<OPTION>at close to the speed of light.

</SELECT>
<br />
<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=> DAMPING RINGS:
<OPTION>In the damping rings,
 the groups of
<OPTION>electrons and positrons are circled round
<OPTION>and round to give the particles time to
<OPTION>radiate energy and settle down into
<OPTION>compact,
 organized bunches.
</SELECT>
<br />
<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=> POSITRON PRODUCTION:
<OPTION>Once the electrons reach a high enough
<OPTION>energy,
 some of them are redirected to

<OPTION>hit a target.  Running into atoms,
 they
<OPTION>create photons,
 which in turn create 
<OPTION>pairs of electrons and positrons.
</SELECT>
<br />
<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=> PEP RING: 
<OPTION>There were six detector areas where electron beams 
<OPTION>collided with positron beams in the PEP storage ring. 
<OPTION>Particles which did not interact stayed in the ring  
<OPTION>with many chances for collisions at subsequent  
<OPTION>crossings. This storage ring facility is now being 
<OPTION>rebuilt into a two ring system so that positrons at
<OPTION>3.1 GeV and electrons at 9 GeV can be stored 
<OPTION>simulatneously.  There will be only one interaction 
<OPTION>region in which these two beams will be brought into  

<OPTION>collision.  This facility is know as PEPII,
 or the 
<OPTION>SLAC B Factory.
</SELECT>
<br />
<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=> SLC: 
<OPTION> The SLC ( Stanford Linear Collider) was
<OPTION>completed in 1988.  Electron and positron
<OPTION>beams collide only once  on the far right
<OPTION>where the two arrows are pointing at each
<OPTION>other.  The beams are focused to 1/1000
<OPTION>the diameter of a human hair, so the 
e- and e+
<OPTION>particles have a greater chance of colliding.
</SELECT>
<br />

<SELECT NAME=question>
<OPTION SELECTED=> SPEAR RING:
<OPTION>This colliding-beam storage ring facility
<OPTION>operated at up to 3 GeV per beam.  It was the
<OPTION>site of the discoveries in 1974 and 1975 of
<OPTION>the particles containing charm quarks, and of
<OPTION>the tau lepton.   This ring is no longer used for
<OPTION>particle physics studies but is dedicated to
<OPTION>the studies which use synchrotron radiation
<OPTION>for a variety of studies of matter.
