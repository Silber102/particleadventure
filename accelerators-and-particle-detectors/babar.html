The B factory detector, BaBar, 
will be built by an international collaboration. It 
will be built
especially to create pairs of electrically neutral B and anti-B mesons. The 
neutral B contains
an anti-b quark and a d quark while the neutral anti-B 
contains a b quark and 
an anti-d.
Physicists will tune the two beams so that when they collide they will have 
exactly enough
energy to create these two mesons. Because the electrons and positrons are 
circling at
different energies, the B and anti-B mesons which are created will be moving 
very quickly in
the same direction. 
They both will travel in the same direction that the faster 
moving electrons
were. This will let physicists infer how long they last before they decay by 
looking at how far
they get. If, as physicists expect, the 
B's and the anti-B's decay to certain sets of 
particles at
different rates 
(unlike most particle-antiparticle pairs, which are identical in 
every respect but
charge), this study could help answer lingering questions about the 
differences between
matter and antimatter.
<p>
The experiment is called "BaBar" because it deals with B and anti-b mesons. 
Since the physics term for anti-b-meson is b-bar, 
physicists decided that "B  B- Bar" wasn't as cute a name as "BaBar."
