<p>
		We ignored the color force field that develops as the b quark and b antiquark move apart. This energy is converted into another quark/antiquark pair; eventually only distinct, color-neutral particles emerge (B mesons). The same is true for the u quark and d antiquark. To see what really happens look at an analogous process in the picture of e+ and e- --> D+ and D-.
