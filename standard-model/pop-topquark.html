On March 2, 1995, Fermilab announced the discovery of the top quark, the last of the six predicted
 quarks. The search began in 1977 when physicists found the fifth quark, bottom, at Fermilab. It took
this long because the top quark was much more massive than was originally imagined, so it required a
more powerful accelerator to create it. 
<p>
Although the top quark decays too fast to be observed, it does leave behind particles that give evidence of
its existence - <a href="pop-topevent.html">a top quark "signature"</a>. The top quark can decay in more than one way. Since a top
quark appears only once in several billion collisions, it was necessary to perform trillions of collisions. 
<p>
Physicists still do not understand why the top is so massive. It is 40 times heavier than the next heaviest
quark and about 35,000 times heavier than the up and down quarks that make up most of the matter we
see around us. In fact the question still remains why particles have such different masses.
